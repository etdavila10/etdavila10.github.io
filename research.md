## Research Interest

While at San Diego State, my main interest was in Algrebraic Combinatorics and in particular Numerical Semigroups and Polytopes which was research conducted under Dr. Christopher O'Neill. I also participated in MSRI-UP where I had the opportunity to work with Lie Algebras under Dr. Pamela E. Harris. Since starting graduate school, I found myself drawn to the application of mathematics to real world problems. Because of this, I have started reading about the mathematics behind climate change under Dr. Richard McGehee.

    I received my Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota &mdash; Twin Cities
    on August 2025. My dissertation was titled "Differential Primary
    Decomposition for Graded Rings". My advisor was

    My research interests include toric varieties, modules of differential
    operators, numerical semigroups, and free resolutions.

        Each numerical semigroup $S$ with smallest positive element $m$
        corresponds to an integer point in a polyhedral cone $C_m$, known as the Kunz
        cone. The faces of $C_m$ form a stratification of numerical semigroups that
        has been shown to respect a number of algebraic properties of $S$, including
        the combinatorial structure of the minimal free resolution of the defining
        toric ideal $I_S$. In this work, we prove that the structure of the infinite
        free resolution of the ground field $\Bbbk$ over the semigroup algebra
        $\mathbb k[S]$ also respects this stratification, yielding a new
        combinatorial approach to classifying homological properties like Golodness
        and rationality of the poincare series in this setting. Additionally, we give
        a complete classification of such resolutions in the special case $m = 4$,
        and demonstrate that the associated graded algebras do not generally respect
        the same stratification.

        The multigraded BGG correspondence in Macaulay2

        We give an overview of a Macaulay2 package for computing with the
        multigraded BGG correspondence. This software builds on the package BGG due
        to Abo-Decker-Eisenbud-Schreyer-Smith-Stillman, which concerns the standard
        graded BGG correspondence. In addition to implementing the multigraded BGG
        functors, this package includes an implementation of differential modules and
        their minimal free resolutions, and it contains a method for computing
        strongly linear strands of multigraded free resolutions.

        Numerical semigroups, polyhedra, and posets III: minimal presentations and face dimension

        This paper is the third in a series of manuscripts that examine the
        combinatorics of the Kunz polyhedron $P_m$, whose positive integer points are
        in bijection with numerical semigroups (cofinite subsemigroups of
        $\mathbb Z \geq 0$) whose smallest positive element is $m$. The faces of
        $P_m$ are indexed by a family of finite posets (called Kunz posets) obtained
        from the divisibility posets of the numerical semigroups lying on a given
        face. In this paper, we characterize to what extent the minimal presentation
        of a numerical semigroup can be recovered from its Kunz poset. In doing so,
        we prove that all numerical semigroups lying on the interior of a given face
        of $P_m$ have identical minimal presentation cardinality, and we provide a
        combinatorial method of obtaining the dimension of a face from its
        corresponding Kunz poset.

        Infinite free resolutions over numerical semigroup algebras via specialization

        Each numerical semigroup $S$ with smallest positive element $m$
        corresponds to an integer point in a polyhedral cone $C_m$, known as the Kunz
        cone. The faces of $C_m$ form a stratification of numerical semigroups that
        has been shown to respect a number of algebraic properties of $S$, including
        the combinatorial structure of the minimal free resolution of the defining
        toric ideal $I_S$. In this work, we prove that the structure of the infinite
        free resolution of the ground field $\Bbbk$ over the semigroup algebra
        $\mathbb k[S]$ also respects this stratification, yielding a new
        combinatorial approach to classifying homological properties like Golodness
        and rationality of the poincare series in this setting. Additionally, we give
        a complete classification of such resolutions in the special case $m = 4$,
        and demonstrate that the associated graded algebras do not generally respect
        the same stratification.

        The multigraded BGG correspondence in Macaulay2

        We give an overview of a Macaulay2 package for computing with the
        multigraded BGG correspondence. This software builds on the package BGG due
        to Abo-Decker-Eisenbud-Schreyer-Smith-Stillman, which concerns the standard
        graded BGG correspondence. In addition to implementing the multigraded BGG
        functors, this package includes an implementation of differential modules and
        their minimal free resolutions, and it contains a method for computing
        strongly linear strands of multigraded free resolutions.

        Numerical semigroups, polyhedra, and posets III: minimal presentations and face dimension

        This paper is the third in a series of manuscripts that examine the
        combinatorics of the Kunz polyhedron $P_m$, whose positive integer points are
        in bijection with numerical semigroups (cofinite subsemigroups of
        $\mathbb Z \geq 0$) whose smallest positive element is $m$. The faces of
        $P_m$ are indexed by a family of finite posets (called Kunz posets) obtained
        from the divisibility posets of the numerical semigroups lying on a given
        face. In this paper, we characterize to what extent the minimal presentation
        of a numerical semigroup can be recovered from its Kunz poset. In doing so,
        we prove that all numerical semigroups lying on the interior of a given face
        of $P_m$ have identical minimal presentation cardinality, and we provide a
        combinatorial method of obtaining the dimension of a face from its
        corresponding Kunz poset.

        Numerical semigroups, polyhedra, and posets II: Locating certain

        Several recent papers have examined a rational polyhedron $P_m$ whose
        integer points are in bijection with the numerical semigroups
        (cofinite, additively closed subsets of the non-negative integers)
        containing $m$. A combinatorial description of the faces of $P_m$ was
        recently introduced, one that can be obtained from the divisibility
        posets of the numerical semigroups a given face contains. In this
        paper, we study the faces of $P_m$ containing arithmetical numerical
        semigroups and those containing certain glued numerical semigroups, as
        an initial step towards better understanding the full face structure of
        $P_m$. In most cases, such faces only contain semigroups from these
        families, yielding a tight connection to the geometry of $P_m$.

        Visualizing the Support of Kostant's Weight Multiplicity Formula for
        the Rank Two Lie Algebras
      </h1>

        The multiplicity of a weight in a finite-dimensional irreducible
        representation of a simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ can be computed
        via Kostant's weight multiplicity formula. This formula consists of an
        alternating sum over the Weyl group (a finite group) and involves a
        partition function known as Kostant's partition function. Motivated by
        the observation that, in practice, most terms in the sum are zero, our
        main results describe the elements of the Weyl alternation sets. The
        Weyl alternation sets are subsets of the Weyl group which contributes
        nontrivially to the multiplicity of a weight in a highest weight
        representation of the Lie algebras $\mathfrak{'{'}so{'}'}_4(\mathbb C),
        \mathfrak{'{'}so{'}'}_5(\mathbb C), \mathfrak{'{'}sp{'}'}_4(\mathbb
        C)$, and the exceptional Lie algebra $\mathfrak g_2$. By taking a
        geometric approach, we extend the work of Harris, Lescinsky, and Mabie
        on $\mathfrak {'{'}sl{'}'}_3(\mathbb C)$, to provide visualizations of
        these Weyl alternation sets for all pairs of integral weights $\lambda$
        and $\mu$ of the Lie algebras considered.

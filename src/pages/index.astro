    <h1>PhD in Mathematics</h1>
    <p>
      Most of my formal education has been dedicated to understanding the structure
      of ideals of affine semigroup rings using the polyhedral geometry of the
      underlying cone. This is mathematical jargon to say I look for patterns
      inside of cones that help explain deep algebraic structures. My dissertation
      is "Differential Primary Decomposition for Graded Rings" which I defended
      on August 5, 2025.
    </p>
    <p>Listed are the latest three articles I have co-authored.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Infinite free resolutions over numerical semigroup algebras via specialization</li>
      <li>The multigraded BGG correspondence in Macaulay2</li>
      <li>Numerical semigroups, polyhedra, and posets III: minimal presentations and face dimension</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Pythonista</h1>
    <p>
      I wrote my first line of code during my introduction to computer science
      course during my first year at San Diego State University. I have written
      countless lines of Python code for things from classroom to academic projects.

    <h1>Web Developer</h1>
    <p>
      In Summer 2023, I had my first break interning at Amazon as a software
      developer engineer. At Amazon, my team's tech stack was React, Spring,
      and SQL. I processed millions of rows of data using SQL, created the
      backend logic with Spring (Java), and developed a customer-facing UI in
      React (TypeScript).

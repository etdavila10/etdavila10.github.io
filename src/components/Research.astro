      Greetings! ðŸ‘‹ I am currently in my fourth year pursuing a Ph.D. at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, delving into the fascinating realms of commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. Under the guidance of <a href='https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~cberkesc/' class='hover:text-teal underline'>Christine Berkesch</a>, I am dedicated to advancing my expertise in these fields.
    </p>
    <p>
    My academic journey has been shaped by a profound interest in combinatorics, which took root during my undergraduate years. My exploration in this area began in earnest during my third year at SDSU, where I engaged in research under the mentorship of <a href='https://cdoneill.sdsu.edu/' class='hover:text-teal underline'>Christopher O'Neill</a>. This collaboration extended until my graduation, and during this period, I actively contributed to the exploration of Numerical Semigroups, approaching the subject from both combinatorial and geometric perspectives.

    abstract='This paper is the third in a series of manuscripts that examine the combinatorics of the Kunz polyhedron Pm, whose positive integer points are in bijection with numerical semigroups (cofinite subsemigroups of â„¤â‰¥0) whose smallest positive element is m. The faces of Pm are indexed by a family of finite posets (called Kunz posets) obtained from the divisibility posets of the numerical semigroups lying on a given face. In this paper, we characterize to what extent the minimal presentation of a numerical semigroup can be recovered from its Kunz poset. In doing so, we prove that all numerical semigroups lying on the interior of a given face of Pm have identical minimal presentation cardinality, and we provide a combinatorial method of obtaining the dimension of a face from its corresponding Kunz poset.'

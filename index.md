## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="#" alt="profile picture">

Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Eduardo and I am currently a third-year math PhD student at the University of Minnesota. I graduated in May 2020 with a Bachelors of Science in Applied Mathematics and a minor in Computer Science from San Diego State University.

## Research Interest

While at San Diego State, my main interest was in Algrebraic Combinatorics and in particular Numerical Semigroups and Polytopes which was research conducted under Dr. Christopher O'Neill. I also participated in MSRI-UP where I had the opportunity to work with Lie Algebras under Dr. Pamela E. Harris. Since starting graduate school, I found myself drawn to the application of mathematics to real world problems. Because of this, I have started reading about the mathematics behind climate change under Dr. Richard McGehee.

## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="assets/images/square_profile_picture.jpg" alt="profile picture">

Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Eduardo and I am currently a third-year math PhD student at the University of Minnesota. I graduated in May 2020 with a Bachelors of Science in Applied Mathematics and a minor in Computer Science from San Diego State University. I really enjoy to code in Python mainly using it to write small scripts that make my life easier. I have also used it to make some nice projects related to research papers that I have worked on in the past. Outside of academics, I am definitely a dog person and on my free time I usually hang out with friends or climb.
